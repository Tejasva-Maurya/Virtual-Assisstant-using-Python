# Virtual Assistant using Python

## Description: 
The “Virtual-Assistant-using-Python” project is an innovative creation of a small, yet powerful virtual assistant built using Python. This assistant is designed to perform a multitude of tasks based on given instructions, and it can be further customized with new instructions to serve as a personalized AI companion.

## Features:

### Voice Activation: 
The assistant is activated through voice commands, making it user-friendly and accessible.
### Speech Recognition: 
Integrates Python’s speech_recognition library to accurately interpret user commands.
### Text-to-Speech: 
Utilizes the pyttsx3 library to provide audible responses, enhancing user interaction.
### Customizable Tasks: 
Designed with flexibility in mind, allowing users to add new tasks and commands to the assistant’s repertoire.

## Files in the Repository:

- Assistant.py: Contains the core functionalities of the virtual assistant.
- Main.py: The main script that initiates the assistant and handles voice activation.
- game.py: An example of a game( task) that the assistant can perform, showcasing the potential for further development.

## How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run Main.py to start the assistant and follow the voice prompts to activate and interact with it.

## Contribution: 
The project is open for contributions and welcomes developers to add new features or improve existing ones. Whether it’s enhancing the AI’s capabilities or optimizing performance, your contributions can help evolve this virtual assistant into an even more versatile tool.

## Future Scope: 
The roadmap for this project includes integrating more advanced AI features, improving the natural language processing capabilities, and expanding the assistant’s task handling capacity to cover a wider range of activities.
